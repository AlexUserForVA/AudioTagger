"""This module implements a consumer which takes audio input
chunks and computes the corresponding spectrogram for
visual representation. It takes audio chunks from the shared
memory in ``AudioTaggerManager`` based on the global timing
variable ``tGroundTruth``.
Due to performance issues, the computations are cached and only the
audio chunk indicated by ``tGroundTruth`` is computed newly by a
separate Thread (SlidingWindowThread). Finally, this produces a cached spectrogram as a
sliding window over time.
Finally the method ``onNewVisualisationCalculated(spec)`` informs the ``AudioTaggerManager``
that a new spectrogram is available.
